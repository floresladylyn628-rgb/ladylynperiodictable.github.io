    Cadmium is a chemical element, symbolized as Cd, and is a soft, bluish-white, toxic metal. It's used in batteries, pigments, coatings, and some industrial applications. However, cadmium's 
    toxicity and environmental concerns require careful handling and disposal.
   </p>
   <p>
    Cadmium was discovered by German chemists Friedrich Stromeyer and Karl Samuel Leberecht Hermann in 1817. They discovered it as an impurity in zinc carbonate. The name "cadmium" comes from the Latin word "cadmia," meaning "calamine," a zinc ore.
     Cadmium is often found in small amounts in zinc ores and is produced as a byproduct of zinc refining.
